# Experiment 3 – Implementing Routing in Single Page Applications (SPA)

This repository contains **Experiment 3.1** and **Experiment 3.3**, demonstrating the implementation of **client-side routing** in a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router**.

---

## 🔬 Experiment 3.1: Basic Client-Side Routing Using React Router

### 🎯 Aim
To implement basic client-side routing in a Single Page Application using **React Router**.

---

### 🛠 Software Requirements
- **Node.js**
- **React**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Web Browser**

---

### 📘 Description
This experiment demonstrates how a Single Page Application navigates between multiple pages **without reloading the browser** using React Router.

---

### ⚙️ Functionalities Implemented
- Client-side routing using `BrowserRouter`
- Navigation between pages using `Link`
- Route configuration using `Routes` and `Route`
- Smooth page transitions without refresh
- Clean and minimal UI layout

---

### 🧩 Pages / Components
- **Home Page**
- **About Page**
- **Contact Page**
- **Navigation Bar**

---

### 🔄 Routing Behavior
- Clicking navigation links changes the URL
- Page content updates dynamically
- Browser does not reload

---

### ✅ Output
The application successfully navigates between different pages using client-side routing, confirming the correct implementation of React Router.

---

## 🔬 Experiment 3.3: Navigation Between Components Using React Router

### 🎯 Aim
To implement navigation between multiple components in a React SPA, including **default routing** and **fallback routing**.

---

### 🛠 Software Requirements
- **Node.js**
- **React**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Web Browser**

---

### 📘 Description
This experiment focuses on routing between major application components such as **Profile** and **Dashboard**, including automatic redirection for invalid routes.

---

### ⚙️ Functionalities Implemented
- Default route loading (Profile page)
- Navigation between Profile and Dashboard
- Redirection using `Navigate`
- Handling invalid URLs
- SPA behavior without page reload

---

### 🧩 Pages / Components
- **Profile Page**
- **Dashboard Page**
- **Navigation Bar**

---

### 🔄 Routing Behavior
- Application loads **Profile page by default**
- Users can navigate to Dashboard
- Invalid routes redirect back to Profile

---

### ✅ Output
The application correctly handles navigation between components and redirects unknown routes, demonstrating efficient SPA routing.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **React (Vite)**
- **React Router DOM**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Both experiments successfully demonstrate the implementation of **client-side routing** in React using React Router, enabling fast navigation, improved performance, and a smooth user experience without page reloads.
